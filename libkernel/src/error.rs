//! Unified kernel error types.
//!
//! This module defines the error hierarchy used throughout the kernel.
//! [`KernelError`] is the top-level enum and wraps domain-specific errors such
//! as [`MapError`], [`FsError`], [`IoError`], and others. A [`Result<T>`] type
//! alias is provided for convenience.
//!
//! The [`syscall_error`] submodule maps [`KernelError`] variants to their POSIX
//! `errno` equivalents for returning values to user space.
